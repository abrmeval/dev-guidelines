.NET APIS should follow the standard .NET naming conventions, which include:
- API Versions: camelCase with a "v" prefix (e.g., `v1`, `v2`)
- should use semantic versioning for API versions (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.1`)
- API versioning should be implemented using URL path segments (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`)
