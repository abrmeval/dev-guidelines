All documents should be named using clear, descriptive titles that reflect their content and purpose.
- Use UpperCase for document titles (e.g., `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`, `API_VERSIONING.md`).
- Use underscores to separate words in file names (e.g., `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`).
- Avoid using spaces or special characters in file names.
