Documentation projects can be built using the following tools:
Docusaurus
docmd.io

All documentation files should follow the naming conventions outlined in the NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md file, which include:
- Use UpperCase for document titles (e.g., `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`, `API_VERSIONING.md`).
- Use underscores to separate words in file names (e.g., `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`).
